3. codekata practice

// Getting input via STDIN
const readline = require("readline");

const inp = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin
});

const userInput = [];

inp.on("line", (data) => {
  userInput.push(data);
});

inp.on("close", () => {
  //start-here
  //Your code goes here â€¦ replace the below line with your code logic 
var firstline = userInput[0];
var secondline = userInput[1];
var thirdline = userInput[2];

console.log(firstline);
console.log(secondline);
console.log(thirdline);
  

  //end-here
});

INPUT:

2 5
2 5 6
2 4 5

OUTPUT:

2 5
2 5 6
2 4 5
